# About Misc
This folder contains a point-in-time all-purpose docker-compose.yml file that is generated by the shell script provided on https://tezos.gitlab.io/
Specifically, the script that generated the docker-compose file is found under the section on Docker: https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#using-docker-images

This docker-compose file can be used to see how additional containers can be added to your node. For example, baker, endorser and accuser.

Other than the tezos binaries, you could also add containers for dApps or custom code that you want to package with a node. That's one of the benefits of docker-compose.
